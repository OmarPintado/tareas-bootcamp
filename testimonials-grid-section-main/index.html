            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
            company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
            have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
            grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
            a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
            learning from their experiences was easy.

        <div class="testimonial-card__text">
            “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave
            me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
            developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an

            Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”
